# We used 'authorization' as our header for a while so this is a stopgap. 
# In the future need to change to a real auth header w/ basic auth. 
# This is still secure, but it requires us to have this headers file and the configmap,
# so that ingress-nginx knows to pass the `authorization` header to the server
# without this, users cannot log in.
