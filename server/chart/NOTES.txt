Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}.

Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }}.

To learn more about the release, try:

  $ helm status {{ .Release.Name }}
  $ helm get all {{ .Release.Name }}


  You should be soon be able to send an HTTPS request to {{ .Values.apiHostname }}/graphql to access the Gigbox API.

  To test if requests are working properly, you can run:

  curl -L https://{{ .Values.apiHostname }}

  You should get back "go to /graphql" as a response.


  This chart relies on two directories on the host machine:

  - {{ .Values.hostOSRMPath }}
  - /data/gigbox


The first is the path you specified in `values.yml` that hosts the extracted OSRM data for your region.

The second stores consent signatures.

In solidarity,

-dc
