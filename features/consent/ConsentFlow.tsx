                    By participating in this study, you will help estimate the effective wages of
                    app-based workers like yourself, and help researchers make better tools for
                    workers to track wages, time, and expenses. You will also help uncover any pay
                    discrepancies people of different backgrounds might make from gig work, and help
                    measure how safe gig work is for workers. To do this, the app uses your
                    location, screenshots you take of your work apps, and your survey responses.
