Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or make a purchase from gigbox.media.mit.edu or use the gigbox app (the “App”).

PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT

When you visit the App, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device, none of which is linked to your identity. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”

We collect other information in the following ways:

- Location data, using sensors built into your mobile phone
- Images you upload to the App
- Survey questionairre data you answer and submit to the App
- Data on job and shifts you submit through using the App
- Your name, phone number, and email, if you choose to provide that information to be contacted for an interview.


If you do not provide your phone number, name, or email to be contacted for an interview, we will have no personal identifiers linked to any of the data collected through the App besides a unique identifier created from your phone number, used only to log you in.

When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information.

HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

We use this information to provide the services rendered in the App, namely, work and mileage tracking. 

We also use this information, with your consent, to produce research content about those using the app *in aggregate*. For more details on research use, see the consent pages of the app. 

We do not share your personal information with any third parties except for other researchers that you explicitly consent to, and to comply with applicable laws and regulations. 


DATA RETENTION

If you opt-out of the study, all data we have collected attached to your identifier is deleted. 

MINORS
